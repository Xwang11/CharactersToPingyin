# Chinese to Pinyin

This project is a simple yet effective tool designed to aid in learning Mandarin Chinese. It takes input of Mandarin characters and displays them with their corresponding pinyin underneath. This layout helps learners associate characters with their pronunciation, making it easier to read Chinese text.

# Motivation

I made this project because I really wanted to learn a song in mandarin, but struggled with reading the characters. By seeing the pinyin directly under the characters, it becomes much easier to practice and improve reading skills. This is a tool that I've always wanted, so id like to make it avalible to everyone as well. 

# Features

Character Input: Users can input Mandarin characters.

Pinyin Output: The tool displays the input characters with their corresponding pinyin underneath.

# Development
This was made with React, deployed on Vercel.
